# SchoolMockaroo

SchoolMockaroo is a mock database project aimed at simulating a school management system using PostgreSQL. It provides a sample database schema and data generated with Mockaroo testing purposes.

## Features

- **Database Schema**: The project includes an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram outlining the database schema.
- **Mock Data**: Sample data is generated using Mockaroo to populate the database tables.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system used for this project is PostgreSQL, ensuring compatibility and reliability.

## Steps

- Setup the Postgre on your machine and create a DB.
- Add tables respective to ER diagrams
- Add data to each table with minimum of 100 rows.
- Write a Select query with and without conditions.
- Write an insert query to add new data for all the tables
- Write an Delete query to delete any existing data for all the tables.
- Write an Update query to update any existing data for all the tables.

## Acknowledgments

- Mockaroo for providing an easy-to-use tool for generating mock data.
- PostgreSQL for its powerful database management capabilities.
